# NOte of Nerual Network and Deep Learning (English Version)

Ok, now let's begin our adventure.
---

**A news I get from the course I took today(20230830) is, the laboratory component of this course, will be taught in Chinese till the final week.

So I created a new note written in Chinese very reluctantly. Cause I can't write in English with the Chinese environment at the same time.

I make a attempt to translate my notes into English in some days.
